# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
Each year, I plan to use a different programming language, with all code organized in the respective year's directory.

I'm starting this journey in 2024, but at some point I want to solve puzzles from previous years as well.

## What languages did I use?

- [2025](./2025/README.md): **Ts** (In Progress)
- [2024](./2024/README.md): **Go** (50⭐)
- [2023](./2023/README.md): **Java** (On Pause)
- [2015](./2015/README.md): **Minecraft** (Slow Progress)

Instructions on how to run the solutions are in the specific year's readme.
